Word Blitz is a Facebook game where two players try to find and select words on a 4x4 grid of random letters. My aunt challenged me to play this game but she was really good and kept beating me, so I made a program and whooped her butt.

Disclaimer: This program was created in Summer 2019 and it is really messy because I didn't know how to organize code back then. But it's still cool.
